# Code Quiz

This is a website that offers a JavaScript quiz to test the user's knowledge. When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, a timer starts and the game begins. The quiz presents 5 random questions from a database and the user earns points for correct answers and loses points for incorrect answers. Each wrong answer results in a deduction of 5 seconds from the timer. Once the timer runs out or all questions have been answered, a summary page displays the user's final score. The user can save their score to localStorage and also delete it.
